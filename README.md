## Installation

This project was made with the Deno Javascript/Typescript runtime environment,
so make sure you have Deno installed on your system to install the `conv`. You
can install Deno from https://deno.land/#installation.

```sh
deno install -A -n conv https://deno.land/x/conv/index.ts
```

## Usage

`conv` was made with the well-known NPM package `inquirer` to ask questions to
the user _on the fly_ (when the program is running), so all you need to do is
execute the program and follow the prompt instructions.

```sh
conv
   _     ____                            _  
  | |   / ___|   ___    _ __   __   __  | | 
 / __) | |      / _ \  | '_ \  \ \ / / / __)
 \__ \ | |___  | (_) | | | | |  \ V /  \__ \
 (   /  \____|  \___/  |_| |_|   \_/   (   /
  |_|                                   |_| 
? Select 'from' currency: EUR
? Select 'to' currency: USD
EUR = 1.0864957797 USD ðŸ’±
? Retry? No
Bye ðŸ‘‹
```

## Options

If you are more of that fast-single-command type of person, you may want to use
the command options available.

- `-f, --from`: Set the _from_ currency, i.e. the base currency.
- `-t, --to`: Set the _to_ currency, i.e. the converted currency.

> You have to provide for both `-f` and `-t` options its respectives currency
> codes (capitalized, uncapitalized or mixed). You can see the list of
> currencies supported with the `list` command as seen in the section below.

## Commands

`conv` also includes the following commands.

- `list`: Lists the currencies available.
- `help`: Shows the options and commands and their description.

## API Usage

The API used in order to get the currency data is the FreecurrencyAPI
(https://freecurrencyapi.com/). Unfortunately, this program does not offer a
full dedicated API key(s) to provide a better user experience.

However, you can still get a 100% free API key ðŸ”‘ by signing up in their website
https://freecurrencyapi.com/register. When you successfully register, you will
get a key that you can use with this application.

Next, you just need to export an environment variable `FC_API_KEY`.

```sh
export FC_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
```

As a convenience, you can export the variable automatically every time you start
a shell editing your `.bashrc` file or equivalent shell.

```bash
# ~/.bashrc
...
export FC_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
```

Finally, just run `conv` and it should be ready to use ðŸš€.
