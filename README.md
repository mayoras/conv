CLI for dual-currency conversion made with Typescript and Deno.

## Installation

This project was made with the Deno Javascript/Typescript runtime environment,
so make sure you have Deno installed on your system to install the `conv`. You
can install Deno from https://deno.land/#installation.

```sh
deno install -A -n conv https://deno.land/x/conv/main.ts
```

## Usage

`conv` was made with the well-known NPM package `inquirer` to ask questions to
the user _on the fly_ (when the program is running), so all you need to do is
execute the program and follow the prompt instructions.

```sh
$ conv
   _     ____                            _  
  | |   / ___|   ___    _ __   __   __  | | 
 / __) | |      / _ \  | '_ \  \ \ / / / __)

 (   /  \____|  \___/  |_| |_|   \_/   (   /
  |_|                                   |_| 
? Select 'from' currency: EUR
? Select 'to' currency: USD
EUR = 1.0864957797 USD ðŸ’±
? Retry? No

```

## Options

If you are more of that fast-single-command type of person, you may want to use
the command options available.

- `-f, --from`: Set the _from_ currency, i.e. the base currency.
- `-t, --to`: Set the _to_ currency, i.e. the converted currency.
- `-l, --list-currency`: Lists the currencies available.

> You have to provide for both `-f` and `-t` options its respectives currency
> codes (capitalized, uncapitalized or mixed). You can see the list of
> currencies supported with the `-l` option as seen above.
